OSCAR is a tool to create beautiful graphical user interaces (GUIs) to send OSC messages and control interactive installations ([Modul8](https://www.garagecube.com/modul8/), [MapMapper](https://madmapper.com/), [Resolume arena](https://resolume.com/), [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/), [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/), [Processing](https://processing.org/), [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/), [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/), etc).
Let's create beautiful, responsive and touchable interfaces.

Build a layout in the browser, drop in buttons and sliders, point each one at an IP, port and OSC address, then open the same page from a phone or tablet on the same network and use it as a control surface.

## Running OSCAR

Requires [Node.js 18 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trafalmejo/OSCAR
cd OSCAR
npm install     # also installs the browser libraries under public/
npm start       # builds the bundle and starts the server
```

OSCAR opens your browser at `http://localhost:8080` and also prints a LAN
address such as `http://192.168.1.20:8080`. Open that second address on a phone
or tablet on the same Wi-Fi to use the interface as a control surface.

Make sure your firewall allows communication between devices on the network.

### Useful commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | Build the browser bundle, then run the server |
| `npm run serve` | Run the server without rebuilding |
| `npm run dev` | Rebuild on change and restart on change |
| `npm test` | Run the test suite |

### Configuration

All optional, set as environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OSCAR_HTTP_PORT` | `8080` | Web interface |
| `OSCAR_SOCKET_PORT` | `8081` | Browser-to-server OSC bridge |
| `OSCAR_LAN_PORT` | `5001` | Source port for OSC sent to the network |
| `OSCAR_LOCAL_PORT` | `5002` | Source port for OSC sent to this machine |
| `OSCAR_PROJECTS_DIR` | `./projects` | Where saved projects are written |
| `OSCAR_NO_OPEN` | unset | Set to `1` to not open a browser on start |

## Saving your work

The canvas autosaves into your browser as you work.

**Save** and **Load** keep a library of named projects, stored as plain JSON
files in the `projects/` folder next to OSCAR. They are ordinary files, so you
can copy, back up and share them however you like.

> **Note for OSCAR 1.x users:** the old online accounts at
> `account.createwithoscar.com` no longer exist. OSCAR now stores everything on
> your own machine, and no longer asks you to log in.

## How it works

```
Browser (grapesjs editor + OSCAR widgets)
   |  socket.io  :8081
   v
OSCAR server (Node/Express)
   |  UDP
   v
Your lighting / video / sound software
```

Widgets carry their own OSC settings (IP, port, address, value). When you press
a button or move a slider the browser sends that over socket.io to the OSCAR
server, which emits the actual OSC packet over UDP.
